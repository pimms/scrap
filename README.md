The crappy scripting language Scrap. This is a hobby exercise for 
compiler development, and should for the foreseeable future  be 
disregarded on all grounds in terms of real world application.

Some major design flaws in the compiler and bytecode architecture made 
me decide to do a FULL rewrite. The new version is nothing like the 
previous version in any way. Why not just create a new project?
I like the name :)
