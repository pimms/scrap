BINARY FORMAT DESCRIPTION
	This document explains the format of the binary files in Scrap. 

	The format MAY (TBD) be used internally as the general input format for the 
	execution module, and WILL be used when executing previously compiled files.


ABSTRACT FORMAT OVERVIEW
	A general, abstract view of the format. Note that the format is stored
	binary, and the XML-like syntax is for clarification purposes only.

	<metadata> ... </metadata>
	<function name="sayHello">
		<return type="void"/>
		<argument type="string" name="name"/>
		<bytecode> ... </bytecode>
	</function>


HIGH LEVEL FORMAT SPECIFICATION
	The following fields define the Scrap binary format. The fields are
	defined in greated detail below. Fields beginning with an E are endian
	sensitive which must be taken into account when both writing and reading.
		[MAGIC_NUMBER]
		[VER_MAJ]
		[VER_MIN]
		[ENDIAN]
		[FUNC_COUNT]
		[MAIN_FUNC]
		[FUNC 1..n]

	MAGIC_NUMBER
		The first five bytes of all Scrap files spell out "SCRAP", 
		capital ASCII format. 
	VER_MAJ
		Single byte that holds the major version number
	VER_MIN
		Single byte that holds the minor version number
	ENDIAN
		The files are stored in binary, so endianess must be taken 
		into account. If the byte ENDIAN is 0x01, the file is BIG 
		ENDIAN. If the byte is 0x02, the file is LITTLE ENDIAN. 
	CLASS_COUNT
		32 bit unsigned holding the number of functions. 
	MAIN_FUNC
		A regular function like any other, but is the first function to
		be called.
	FUNC 1..n
		If (FUNC_COUNT > 1), the remaining functions are defined after
		MAIN_FUNC.
		
FUNCTION FORMAT DETAILS
	FUNCTION TEMPLATE	
		[NAME]						Name of the method
		[NUM]						Number of arguments
			[NAME]					Name of the argument
			[TYPE]					Type of the argument
		[TYPE]						Return type
		[E BYTECODE LENGTH]			Number of bytes in the method body
		[E BYTECODE]				The bytecode itself
	
	xxx NAME
		Null-terminated ASCII name of the class
	CLASS ID 
		32 bit unsigned ID of the class
	SUPER ID
		32 bit unsigned ID of the class. If no superclass, holds the value (~0).
	NUM xxx
		32 bit unsigned, count of "xxx"
	TYPE
		8 bit unsigned, holds a scrap::VarType
	VIRTUAL
		8 bit unsigned bool. 0x00 for FALSE, 0x01 for TRUE.
	BYTECODE LENGTH
		32 bit unsigned, number of bytes in the method body
	BYTECODE
		The bytecode itself. Arguments > 8 bits are endian sensitive.
